# Datasets

The following datasets are used throughout sequence design and analysis:

## Data for training accessibility models

Located in the `dhs_index` subfolder. Processed data can be downloaded via the included [`download_processed_data.sh`](./dhs_index/download_processed_data.sh) script. The [`process_data.ipynb`](./dhs_index/process_data.ipynb) jupyter notebook reproduces our data processing workflow starting from raw, previously-published sources, but re-running this should not be necessary in most cases.
